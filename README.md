A computational method to construct DNA methylation-driven ceRNA networks by integrating DNA methylation and gene expression data. We hypothesize that significantly differentially expressed mRNA/lncRNA in different methylation groups are driven by methylation. By analyzing methylation levels in the promoter regions, we divide the samples into hypo- and hypermethylation groups, extract highly expressed genes, and define methylation-driven ceRNA pairs through shared miRNA and significant co-expression.
